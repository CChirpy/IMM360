# IMM360

- Games I: Design &amp; Architecture | Fall 2022
- Class taught by [Professor Fishburn](https://dct.tcnj.edu/people/faculty/josh-fishburn/)

## Course Description

This is a multidisciplinary course that invites students to learn about the underlying architecture of a game engine while deepening their skills in object-oriented programming and digital game design. This is both an advanced and an introductory course. It is introductory in that it is the first of a two-course sequence in game development in the Interactive Multimedia program. It is advanced in that it assumes preexisting experience with object-oriented programming and assumes that students will be able to quickly get up to speed with it. Students will emerge from the class with stronger programming skills, experience designing and implementing digital game prototypes, familiarity with elements of digital games, such as the asset pipeline of a game engine, audio integrations, designing and building of typical game systems, industry trends and more.

## Learning Goals

### Knowledge and Skills
1. Demonstrate game development habits and conventions (through ideation and planning, paper and digital prototyping, iterative design, and soliciting useful feedback through playtesting).
2. Develop the ability to design and implement a variety of common game mechanics, systems, and interactions.
3. Be able to modify existing code to add features to a game or interactive project.
4. Be able to explain foundational programming concepts (variables, conditional statements and logic, data structures, algorithms, classes and objects, and more) in the context of a modular game development environment (in this case, Unity).
5. Describe and discuss historical and contemporary issues in game design and development from technical, sociopolitical, and artistic/design perspectives.

### Habits and Practices

1. Practice a balance between self-sufficiency and reliance on the classroom community (Use existing online resources and apply your own knowledge to solve problems, but don't be afraid to ask questions).
2. Ask good questions (by making note of what you're trying to do, what happened, and how it was different from what you expected).
3. Document your process (by using code comments to record Jour learning, giving proper attribution/credit, and properly licensing and presenting your work),
4. Practice co-learning (by regularly sharing what you are learning with others, both in person and online, by teaching and/or asking questions).
